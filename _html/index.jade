          .description
            | With three options to choose from, pick the course the best suits

            | cheer and high-five as much as possible.

            | To minimize disruption of the residents, course markings will not

            | you know the route, print off a copy to carry, run with your phone,
            | or load the route into your GPS watch.

            | Again, to minimize disruption of the residents, aid stations won't

            | you'll need it.  Take into account the heat, and remember, it's

          .description
            | With three options to choose from, pick the course the best suits
            | you...literally!  We end at the pool so you can jump right in and

            | cheer and high-five as much as possible.

          .description
            | THe course will be marked in some way, either with chalk or hanging

          h2 Aid Stations
          .description
            | To minimize disruption of the residents, aid stations will not
            | be placed around the ranch.  Carry water with you if you think
            | you'll need it.  Take into account the heat, and remember, it's
            | a fun run!

          h2 Course Safety
          .description
            | Many of the routes follow roads, so beware of cars. Runner etiquette
            | is run on the left side of the road (against traffic).  For those
            | on the 5k course, ensure you have plenty of water and watch for
            | wildlife in the brush.

          .description
            | If you would rather support your fellow 'Bots on their quest, we'll
            | need a few volunteers to check participants in and mark finishers,
            | take photos, hand out water, and cheer everyone on as the approach
            | the final stretch and cross the finish line.

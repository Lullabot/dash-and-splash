                    .description
                        | Many of the routes follow roads, so beware of cars. Runner etiquette
                        | is run on the left side of the road (against traffic).  For those
                        | on the 5k course, ensure you have plenty of water and watch for
                        | wildlife in the brush.

                    p We use Strava to map the routs.  Strava is a free community of active people.  You can use just about any GPS enabled device to sync your activities, use their free app, or manually enter them.
                    p You don't have to use Strava, but we do have a Lullabot Fit Club where we share our runs, rides, and rows, and it's always more fun with more people to give you kudos.

            With three options to choose from, pick the course the best suits
            you...literally!  We end at the pool so you can jump right in and
            cool off before the 3pm activities!  Spectators are encouraged to
            cheer and high-five as much as possible.

          <div class="description">
            To minimize disruption of the residents, course markings will not
            be placed on the roads around Smoke Tree Ranch, so please make sure
            you know the route, print off a copy to carry, run with your phone,
            or load the route into your GPS watch.

          <div class="description">
            Again, to minimize disruption of the residents, aid stations won't
            be placed around the ranch.  Carry water with you if you think
            you'll need it.  Take into account the heat, and remember, it's
            a fun run!
